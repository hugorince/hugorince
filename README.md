Hi! I'm Hugo ðŸ‘‹
After 7 years working as visual artist and creative in various institutions in Paris and MontrÃ©al, I decided to become a software developer.
In october 2022 I joined Ada Tech School in Paris to study Computer Science. I'm currently looking for a one year apprenticeship starting in june 2023. Feel free to contact me :)
